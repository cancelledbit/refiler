# refiler
This is a filehosting system written with Slim 4. You can find it working instance at https://refiler.ru
It also has telegram bot @refilerbot which you can use to upload files directly from TG
The purpose of developing such system was a desire to understand basics of how modern frameworks do thier job under the hood. Anyway codestyle could be slightly bad cuz i made this 
project more than a year ago.
* **This project should be treated as prototype.**

# General description.
This project use php-di as a container, twig as template engine and self written ORM which works with diffrent types of DB's. 
For now it's only partly implemented, yet fully usable as for project needs.
